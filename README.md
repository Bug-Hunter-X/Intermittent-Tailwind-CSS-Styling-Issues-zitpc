# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Styling Issues

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied to HTML elements. The issue is intermittent and difficult to debug, as the problem doesn't always occur with the same classes or class combinations.

## Bug Description

Styles are applied inconsistently. Sometimes a single class (`bg-red-500`) will work fine, while others (`text-white`) on the same element will be ignored.  More complex class combinations sometimes only partially apply.  This makes debugging challenging, as there's no clear pattern to the problem.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Observe the inconsistent application of Tailwind CSS classes.

## Solution

The solution (`bugSolution.html`) demonstrates the resolution using a combination of carefully ordered classes and ensuring that the Tailwind CSS configuration is correctly set up and that the necessary build steps have been performed.  Adding the `!important` flag helped resolve the most critical issues.  See file for details.
