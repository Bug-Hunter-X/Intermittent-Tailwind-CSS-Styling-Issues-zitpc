I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements, even though I had configured Tailwind according to the documentation.  The issue was intermittent and seemed to be related to the order of classes or the specific classes used.  For example, sometimes `bg-red-500` would work, but `text-white` wouldn't on the same element. In other cases, a complex class combination like `flex items-center justify-between` would only partially apply, with some styles missing.
